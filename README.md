# RAW_Lab1
## Description
This lab traverses through the comments on a Reddit thread and
determines whether the comment is negative, neutral, or positive

## General Information
This seciton will provide general information about this program.
* I got this working with Python 3.7, PRAW 6.0.0, & NLTK 3.3
* I only have 2 tescases, one that checks if other subreddit threads work, and one the requires some manual verification to see if the recursion if reaching the end of reply braches
